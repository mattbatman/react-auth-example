This repo is intended as a personal, basic, boilerplate React application demonstrating login with token authentication. It was created while following along with Stephen Grider's course on Udemy, Advanced React and Redux.

It's intended to be used with my [node-server-seed](https://github.com/mattbatman/node-server-seed) example project.
